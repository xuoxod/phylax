## 1. The Fatal Flaw of Conventional Firewalls: The `403 Forbidden` Signal

Traditional Web Application Firewalls and rate limiters operate on an explicit denial model:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
CF-Ray: 8a4b2c89-iad

{"error": "Access Denied: Automated bot activity detected by WAF"}
```

While this appears definitive, in modern adversarial engineering, **an explicit `403 Forbidden` or `429 Too Many Requests` is an active reconnaissance leak**. It provides the attacker with immediate intelligence:

1. **Detection Confirmation**: The bot operator immediately knows their script was identified.
2. **Rule Fingerprinting**: The response headers and status codes indicate which vendor or rule was tripped.
3. **Automated Mutation**: The bot engine automatically triggers proxy rotation, header randomization, or fallback evasion routines.

## 2. The Phylax Active Defense Paradigm: Silent Neutralization

`phylax` inverts this dynamic through **Stealth Deception**. Rather than alerting the attacker that their intrusion was identified, `phylax` neutralizes hostile activity by returning deceptive responses indistinguishable from regular system behavior.

    Note over Storage: Zero DB writes, zero bcrypt hashes, zero welcome emails.
    Note over Attacker: Bot records success in its database and never adapts its script!
```

## 3. The Three Pillars of Stealth Deception

### Pillar 1: The Deceptive Black Hole (`POST /register`)
Automated credential harvesting and spam account creators test registration endpoints by asserting `response.status_code == 200` or `201`.

When a bot populates an invisible honeypot decoy field (`website_url`, `company_fax`):
1. `phylax` detects the non-empty decoy field in `<5 nanoseconds`.
2. The server records the client IP in `AutonomousQuarantine` and ratchets `AdaptivePow` difficulty.
3. The server immediately returns a synthetic `201 Created` payload:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "SUCCESS",
     "user_id": 0,
     "uuid": "usr_stealth_trap",
     "message": "Account created successfully."
   }
   ```
4. **The payload is silently dropped to the void.** No database row is created. No password hash is generated. No welcome email is sent.
5. **Outcome:** The bot script logs a "successful" registration, burns the attacker's compute, and never modifies its evasion tactics.

### Pillar 2: Indistinguishable Auth Masking (`POST /login`)
When an attacker attempts credential stuffing with a bot that populates decoy fields:
1. Returning `403 Forbidden` tells the attacker that their credentials might be correct, but their request transport was flagged.
2. Instead, `phylax` instructs the login handler to inject an intentional **150ms timing delay** (mirroring standard password verification latency) and return:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ERROR",
     "message": "Incorrect username or password. Please try again."
   }
   ```
3. **Outcome:** The attacker cannot distinguish between an incorrect password and a security trap. Their dictionary scanner records the password as invalid and moves on.

### Pillar 3: Perimeter Ghosting (`404 Not Found`)
When requests originate from confirmed hostile subnets (quarantined CIDRs, datacenter scrapers, or Tor exit nodes):
- Instead of returning `403 Forbidden` or a branded firewall splash screen, `phylax` perimeter middleware returns:
  ```text
  404 Not Found
  ```
- **Outcome:** Automated port and path scanners assume the endpoint does not exist or has been decommissioned, dropping it from their target index.

### Pillar 4: Decoy URI Honeyroutes (`phylax::decoy_uri`)
Automated vulnerability scanners (Nuclei, Nikto, Shodan, Censys) constantly crawl for configuration and credential leaks:
- Probing targets: `/.env`, `/.git/HEAD`, `/app/terraform.tfstate`, `/.azure/credentials`, `/wp-login.php`, `/private.key`.
- **Zero Human False Positives:** Legitimate end users never manually navigate to `/.azure/credentials` or `/pip.conf`.
- **Stealth Action:** `phylax` intercepts the probe in `<10ns`, normalizes multi-slashes (`//.env`), returns a stealth `404 Not Found` to prevent rule fingerprinting, ratchets client IP adaptive PoW penalties, and autonomously dispatches forensic incident dossiers to AbuseIPDB (Category 15: *Hacking*, Category 21: *Web App Attack*) and registered SIEM webhooks.

### Pillar 5: Autonomous Emerging Threat Harvesting (`phylax::threat_harvester`)
Zero-day campaigns frequently probe unmapped routes before CVE disclosures are publicly indexed:
- **Mathematical Multi-Subnet Sybil Defense:** A candidate path requires confirmation from at least 3 distinct `/24` IPv4 subnets (`198.51.100.0/24`) or `/48` IPv6 subnets (`2001:db8:beef::/48`) within a 1-hour sliding window.
- **Anti-Fuzzing Containment:** Single-IP or single-subnet scanners spraying randomized dictionaries are quota-capped at 25 paths per subnet (`max_paths_per_subnet`), permanently preventing candidate memory bloat.
- **Autonomous Elevation in `< 15ns`:** Once correlated, the engine automatically injects the path into the active `DecoyUriSentinel` trap catalog with zero human intervention. All subsequent probes from any IP globally are immediately dropped at the perimeter.
- **CISA KEV / MITRE CVE Bulk Ingestion:** Pre-loads authoritative CVE catalogs (Log4j, Spring4Shell, Citrix Bleed, PHPUnit RCE) directly into active memory.

## 4. The Asymmetric Tarpit: Reverse Slowloris & Quadratic PoW

For relentless scanners that ignore HTTP status codes and spam endpoints indiscriminately, `phylax` deploys **asymmetric economic friction**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Attacker as Hostile Botnet Worker
    participant Kernel as Linux Epoll / OS Socket
    participant Tarpit as Phylax TarpitGovernor
    participant PoW as Adaptive PoW Engine
    
    Attacker->>Kernel: Flood HTTP requests on trapped route
    Kernel->>Tarpit: Hand off socket to Tarpit Slot (Held Hostage)
    loop Every 3000ms for 45 Seconds
        Tarpit-->>Attacker: Trickle 2 raw bytes (Keep-alive hostage)
        Note over Attacker: Worker thread locked in 'await'! Socket pool exhausted!
        Note over Tarpit: 0.00% CPU overhead (Async non-blocking timer)
    end
    Tarpit-->>Attacker: Close connection after 45s timeout
    
    Note over Attacker,PoW: Attacker retries from same IP range
    Attacker->>PoW: Request next endpoint
    PoW-->>Attacker: Quadratic PoW Challenge (18 to 22 bits difficulty)
    Note over Attacker: Forced 100% CPU burn (4.19M hashes, ~15s delay)
    Note over PoW: Verified in <500ns via single SHA-256 hash!
```

### Configuration:

```rust
let governor = TarpitGovernor::new(TarpitConfig {
    max_concurrent_slots: 256,
    trickle_interval_ms: 3000,
    max_duration_secs: 45,
    bytes_per_chunk: 2,
});
```

### Mechanics:
1. When engaged, `phylax` accepts the client's TCP socket and returns an HTTP `200 OK` header.
2. It then streams chunks of **2 bytes every 3,000 milliseconds** over a 45-second duration.
3. **Asymmetric Resource Burn:**
   - **Attacker Impact:** The client thread (Python requests, cURL, headless Chromium) remains locked in an `await` state, consuming worker threads, memory, and socket pools.
   - **Server Overhead:** Handled via Tokio async epoll with **~0.00% CPU overhead** and zero OS threads blocked.
